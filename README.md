# Assembly Low-Level I/O Procedures

This is a basic program that will introduce the programmer and title, then provide brief instructions to the user and ask the user to input ten signed decimal integers. The program will then output the list of entered integers, the sum of the integers and the rounded average.

It demonstrates input/output procedures in assembly language.
